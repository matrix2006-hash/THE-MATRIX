THEME:SUSTAINABLE LIVING  & SMART INFRASTRUCTURE
PROBLEM STATEMENT:OVERCROWD MANAGEMENT AND SMART LIVING 
:in many public or private spaces like classrooms,offices,working idustries and labs
there's no automatic way to control room capacity,also there's no automotion way to control emergency exits
and ventilaters during fire hazards also controlling of fans and lights based on presence of the people because its also important to use power efficiently
its very important to know how many were actually present in  a room to avoid overcrowding and suffocation 

COMPONENTS USED:
Arduino UNO-	1	-Main microcontroller
IR Sensors	-2	-For entry & exit detection
DHT11 Sensor	-1	-For humidity measurement
Flame Sensor-	1	-For fire detection
LCD 16x2-	1-	For displaying data
Servo Motor (SG90)-	1-	For automatic door
Relays (2-channel)	-1-	For fan and light control
Buzzer	-1-	For alerts
Breadboard & Jumper Wires	-	For connections
Power Supply (5V)	-1-	For circuit operation

OVERVIEW:
This project is an Arduino-based smart monitoring and safety system designed to manage room occupancy, automate lights and fans, alert users and opens auto exits and ventilators in case of fire detection. it actually counts many persons entering,exiting and total persons present in a room.
It combines ultrasonic/IR sensors, DHT sensor, flame sensor, servo motor, and relays for automation and safety.

COMBINED FEATURES:
*Automatic entry/exit detection: counts people entering/exiting using two IR sensors.
S*mart door control: Servo motor automatically opens/closes the door when someone enters or exits.
*Environmental monitoring: dht11 sensor measures humidity.
*Flame detection: Detects fire and triggers buzzer + alert message on LCD and auto opens doors and ventilator.
*Overcrowd alert: Warns when maximum capacity (e.g 6 people) is exceeded and the entry door doesnt open as to control overgathering.

Automatic Appliance Control:
*Light ON when at least 1 person is inside.
*Fan ON when 3 or more people are inside.
*LCD Display: displays number of people who are inside (ex:IN=4,out=2 total=2 hum=x%, seats=x/6), humidity, and status messages.
*automotion doors for entry and exit & for emergency fire exits.

Future Enhancements:

*Add temperature monitoring.
*Send alerts to mobile via IoT (ESP8266 + Blynk/MQTT).
*include smoke and gas detection.
use ultrasonic sensors instead of IR for better accurac
